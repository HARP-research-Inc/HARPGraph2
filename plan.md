1. Implement pseudo-digraphs with half int indices graph plotting with custom ds + networkx + matplotlib (PseudoDiGraph class)
2. Implement 2D planar graph plotting as extension, where it requires psdigraph is planar (PlanarPseudoDiGraph)
3. Implement dual generation function, which will create duals of ppdg's
4. Implement "clustering" as layeredpsdigraph
5. Implement layered ppdg's
